Understanding Grid layout with numbers

Grid layout can solve all the positioning properties in CSS, where I always tried to avoid by using flexbox.

So what is GRID LAYOUT?

CSS Grid layout brings a two-dimensional layout tool to the web, with the ability to lay out items in rows and columns. CSS Grid can be used to achieve many different layouts. It excels at dividing a page into major regions, or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.

Grid layout allows us to arrange elements in space in a desirable manner (however you want).

Prior to this kind of behavior we could attained layouts by many CSS properties like
display:inline-block
display:flex (one dimensional layout)
floats
